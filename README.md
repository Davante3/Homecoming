# Homecoming
We began with a WireFrame and then we started working. After that we had some issues with making a table but after a day we figured out the problem. After that it went really well until we got to the pictures. First we had to choose a good image that didn't have a background. Then we had to get the images and resize them which wasn't hard but we just didn't know how to do it until we got some help. After we got the right sizes we had to flip an image which we also didn't know how to do so we put the image into slides and flipped it. We did have some arguements over the background color and some colors of the boxes and which images we would use but eventually we all compromised and made a good Homecoming Schedule.
